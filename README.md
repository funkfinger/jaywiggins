# My Site - jaywiggins.com

This is my personal site to keep track of stuff I've run into. It's not very useful, but may have a random tidbit that could help someone get out of something sometime.

This site is built with static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and started with [Poole](http://getpoole.com) - but may have deviated from that a bunch now...

The site uses a <code>Rakefile</code> to manage <code>jekyll</code> tasks. It also relies on services to deal with data needs- for instance [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for comments.
