Close to moving this site over to Jekyll. I tried a number of different static site options including:

  * [Hexo](http://hexo.io/)
  * [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/)
  * [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/)
  
Hexo and Metalsmith were attractive in that they were Node-based. Middleman seems cool, but in the end I went back to an old standby- Jekyll. It worked faster than any of the others, seems a little more customizable - or at least customizable without altering a lot of code, and is really well supported.
